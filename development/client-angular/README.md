# Simple Apollo Angular with `@defer` ⚡️

A demo of `apollo-angular` with the `@defer` directive using Apollo Client's `HttpLink`.

## Running the application

To run the back-end needed for this demo, please visit [client-router-e2e-tests](https://github.com/apollographql/client-router-e2e-tests) and follow the instructions for [Running Apollo Router locally](https://github.com/apollographql/client-router-e2e-tests?tab=readme-ov-file#running-apollo-router-and-cypress-tests-locally) (i.e. from installing Docker Desktop to running `npm run router:up`).

Once the router is running at `http://localhost:4000`, clone and install this repository, `npm i` and run `npm start`. Visit `http://localhost:4200` in the browser and watch `@defer` + Apollo Angular in action.
