## 4.0.0 (2021-10-15)

- This release introduces a significant functionality change: [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and [GraphiQL Explorer](https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer) have been removed and replaced with an embedded version of [Apollo Studio's Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/studio/develop). This means many of the more advanced features of Apollo Studio's Explorer are now available to run against your application's defined GraphQL endpoint, all from the comfort of a browser devtools panel. This change does not require you to have a Studio account and all existing GraphiQL / GraphiQL Explorer functionality has been replicated.
